/**
 * This ViewModel represents potential states of the UI which Display Fragment can render. This
 * includes:
 * Error state - Expression was determined to be invalid. Return error message.
 * Success state - Expression was determined to be valid. Return evaluated Expression
 *
 * The MVVM GUI Architecture Pattern (a.k.a. Presentation Model Ã  la Martin Fowler) is a different concept; but I believe this is a more
 * appropriate usage of the word, imho.
