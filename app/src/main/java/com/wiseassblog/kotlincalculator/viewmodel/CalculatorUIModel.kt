/**
 *
 * Wondering is with UI Model and ViewModel? Well, I'm really not the expert here (not sarcasm),
 * however I would actually prefer to call the thing which I pass around my Presentation Layer as a
 * a ViewModel (I'm referring to what is currently called CalculatorUIModel). I would actually call
 * this thing a ViewController, but that probably would've confused people even worse.
 *
 * Let's try to forget about the names and accept that the goal is separation of concerns and
 * immutability.
 *
 * This UIModel represents potential states of the UI which is to be rendered to Display Fragment. This
 * includes:
 * Error state - Expression was determined to be invalid. Return error message.
 * Success state - Expression was determined to be valid. Return evaluated Expression
 *
 * The MVVM GUI Architecture Pattern (a.k.a. Presentation Model Ã  la Martin Fowler) is a different concept; but I believe this is a more
 * appropriate usage of the word, imho.
